Req 18 - Model Footprint Hierarchy

Req 19 - Model Cutout Zone

Req 20 - Model Cutout Geometry

Req 21 - Model Pseudo-Interior Zone

Req 22 - Model Interior Zone

Req 4 - Layers

|Chap 6.2 - Using hierarchy to organize models helps identify components of intereset |Node Hierarchy fully supported |No |Easy |Yes
|Comment Attribute a|
Req 14 - Zone Names

Chap 6.5.3.1 - Zone Material Index

Req 16 - Hot Spot Temperature

Req 23 - Model Point (Damage)

Req 24 - Model Point (DIS Origin)

Req 25 - Model Point (View Point)

Chap 6.6.2.3 - Model Attach Point

Chap 6.6.2.5 - Model Center of Mass

Req 29 - Damage State (Levels)

Req 36 - Model Vendor Attributes

a|
Comment field is used to extend OpenFlight node for CDB specialization for many uses

A number of constructs are available in the OF spec that could be natively encoded in the format instead of using the comment field.

|Implemented using CDB extension |Yes |Easy |Yes
|Node Attribution |Req 13 - Model Zone Bounding Box a|
Group node has bounding box attribute

Other attributes available on the node:

Roof Flag

Culture Footprint

a|
Primitives have min/max properties.

For general nodes, this must be stored using the CDB extension

|Yes |Easy |Yes
|External Referencing a|
Chap 6.2.4 - Model Master File

Req 6 - Use XRef node to reference other files

Chap 6.2.5.1 - Models straddling multiple files

Chap 6.2.5.2 - Models with multiple LODs

|Model Master File (comprised of xrefs) ensures a Model is seen as a single "object" even though its constituents are stored in separate files |No external referencing |Yes |Difficult a|
Partial

The converter can parse external references and combine them into one gltf file (using mesh instancing for repeated references)

|Level of Detail Node a|
Chap 6.2.5.2 - Models with multiple LODs

Req 26 - Significant Size

Chap 6.8.1 - Exchange LODs

Chap 6.8.2 - Additive LODs

a|
LOD node contained in XRefs in master file

Significant Size attribute on LOD

LOD node support exchange and additive LOD strategies

a|
Requires extension (MSFT_lod)

No sig size. Works with switch in/out

|Yes |Medium a|
Yes

Uses MSFT_lod extension

|Switch Node a|
Req 27 - Switch Masks (one per state)

Req 28 - Switch Mask Names

Req 29 - Damage State (Transition)

Req 31 - Blur State (Transition)

|Switch node supports multiple masks. Each mask can be named. |No native support for this. |Yes |Medium |Yes 

|Degree of Freedom Node a|

Req 32 - Articulation

Req 33 - Gimbal Limits

|DOF node supports min/max limits for each degree of articulation (translation, scale, rotation) a|
Skins, Joints, Animations.

glTF is more flexible/complex than OF when it comes to animated models

|No |Medium |
|Light Point Node |Req 35 - Model Light Points |Light Point node can represent individual points or light "string" a|
No native support.

Existing extensions for light sources but these are a different concept than light points

|Yes |Difficult |
|Projection |Req 1 - Specify Projections |Required projections for GTModel, GSModel, MModel and T2DModel a|
Could be done as part of the CDB extension or using a separate extension to improve interoperability.

Technically not required for CDB because CDB enforces the projection of models. GSModels, GTModels and MModels must use flat earth and T2DModels must use geodetic. 
|No |Medium |
|Coordinate System a|
Req 7 - X (left/right), Y (front/back), Z (bottom/top)

Req 8 - Origin (0,0,0)

|These are native OpenFlight conventions a|
glTF 2.0 uses a right-handed coordinate system, with x point right, y point up and z backward

Changing this requires an extension and would reduce performance and interoperability

Would recommend keeping glTF's axis system and adjusting the standard if needed.

|No |N/A |
|Local Coordinate System |Chap 6.3.1.2 |Transformation Matrix is used to specify LCS |Transformations on nodes |No |Easy |Yes
|Units |Char 6.3.1.3 |Header attribute is used to specify Units |Can be specified in extras property |No |Easy |
|Instancing |Req 11 - Avoid repeating identical pieces of geometry |Efficiency - smaller database size a|
Multiple nodes can instantiate the same mesh.

However, there is no concept of node instancing. OF is more flexible

|No |Medium |Yes
|Mesh |Req 11 - Favor mesh over polygons |Efficiency - smaller database size, fewer graphics states a|
Mesh is supported and highly recommended over polygons.

In OF many models use individual polygon nodes, but this would be inefficient in glTF. May lead to large geojson files.

|No |Easy a|
Yes

Polygon nodes at the same level with the same textures are merged into one mesh

|Vertex Ordering |Req 11 - CCW order of verts define polygon "front" | |GLTF uses CCW ordering of vertices |No |Easy |Yes
|Relative Priority |Req 12 - Layers of coplanar geometry a|
Relative Priority attribute at :

* Face
* Mesh
* Object
* Group

a|Not supported natively. Can be stored in an extension, but per-face priority is more complicated. 

Two possible solutions : 

* Faces with different priorities should be grouped in separate meshes 
* Use an extension to support per-face metadata

|No |Easy |
|Textures a|
Req 37 - Textures stored in separate files from models

Req 41 - Relative Texture Paths

Req 42 - Object Shadow Attribute

|Loading efficiency a|
Textures supported.

Materials in glTF are similar to extended materials in OF, but not all layers from openflight exist in glTF.

Ex: Light map, specular map, reflection map.

Material textures are not a concept in gltf. Would require extension.

|Yes |Difficult |Yes
