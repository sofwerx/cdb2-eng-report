== CDB 2.0 - Background and History

This section of the ER provides background information on the history and development of version 1 of the CDB standard. This background information provides the basis for the SOFWERX/SOCOM decision to sponsor the CDB X Conceptual Modelling activity.

=== What is CDB?

The existing CDB standard defines a standardized model and structure for a single, versionable, virtual representation of the earth. A CDB structured data store provides for a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play interoperable between database authoring workstations. Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks. In this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable between CDB-compliant simulators. A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time.

The application of CDB to future simulation architectures will significantly reduce runtime-source level and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, update and configuration management timelines. With the addition of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_architecture[High Level Architecture] - Federation Object Model (HLA/FOM) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Interactive_Simulation[Distributed Interactive Simulation] (DIS) protocols, the application of the CDB standard provides a common environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common view of the simulated environment.

The CDB standard defines an open format for the storage, access and modification of a synthetic environment database. A *synthetic environment* is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation[computer simulation] that represents activities at a high level of realism, from simulation of theaters of war to factories and manufacturing processes. These environments may be created within a single computer or a vast distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented by super-realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models. SE allows visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated see https://www.msco.mil/MSReferences/Glossary/MSGlossary.aspx["Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Glossary", DoD 5000.59-M,].

This standard defines the organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a full-mission simulator. The standard makes use of several commercial and simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. A series of associated OGC Best Practice documents define rules and guidelines for data representation of real world features.

The CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including external features such as man-made structures and systems. A CDB data store can include terrain relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made cultural features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean bottom, including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor. In addition, the data store can include the specific attributes of the synthetic environment data as well as their relationships.

=== OGC CDB 1.x History

The CDB specification was initially authored by CAE Inc. on November 2005 under a contract administered by the US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) to meet requirements set by US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)for interoperable, high-performance mission rehearsal and simulation federations. CAE along withother companies (e.g., Flight Safety Inc., New York, NY, USA, Presagis Inc., Montréal, QC, Canada, etc.) have delivered hundreds of simulation channels based on CDB to customers in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, Turkey, Israel, Singapore, Australia, Brunei and other countries. 

To improve the efficiency of M&S analysis, facilitate data and services’ interaction and communications, and reduce operational cost and complexity, the CDB Community led by CAE submitted the industry specification version 3.2 into the OGC for consideration as an OGC Best Prctice. Beginning in 2013, CDB was discussed and demonstrated at OGC Technical Committee meetings. The industry specification was approved by the OGC Members and released as an https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61935[OGC Best Practice]. The OGC CDB SWG then split the two Best Practice documents into 12 volumes, removed unnecessary content by providing links to authoritative sources, and began evolving terminology to be consistent with OGC/ISO terms and definitions. CDB Version 1.0 was approved by the OGC membership in October 2016 as a new standard.

The CDB SWG continued the evolution of CDB.  Version 1.1 of the CDB Standard and related Best Practices was approved in August 2018. One of the main enhancements for version 1.1 was guidance on how to encode and include global and local spatial metadata in a CDB data store. Version 1.1 also moved to having file extensions being generic in all CDB Requirements clauses. This was done to allow inclusion of new (additional) file types in a CDB data store. Further, a number of CDB User communitu chnages requests were included in version 1.1.

Version 1.2 of the CDB Standard was approved as an official OGC Standard in August 2020.  The major enhancement in CDB version 1.2 was the inclusion of the ability to add OGC GeoPackage formated containers into a CDB data store. There are two new CDB volumes that explicitly provide requirements and guidance on using GeoPackages in a CDB data store. Version 1.2 also includes two substantive changes. First, the way that CDB’s Primary Alternate Terrain Elevation dataset was defined in CDB Version 1.1 and earlier causes problems with standard open source libraries used to read and process these data. The SWG agreed  to  changes  address  the  issues  that  ground  simulation  has  with  CDB  gridded  terrain meshes. The second substantive change is that CDB  1.1  and  earlier  supported  a  single  (hard-coded)  file  format  per  dataset.  To  allow  other  fileformats to be used in a CDB Data Store, the need to explicitly specify the file format that is used to physically store the components of a given dataset is required.The  current  CDB  metadata  and  controlled  vocabulary  definitions  (See  Clauses  1.4.3,  3.1,  and  5.1  inCDB Volume 1: Core) has a file called Datasets.xml listing all possible datasets that can be used in aCDB  data  store.  The  file  has  been  expanded  to  indicate  the  encoding  format  used  to  encode  the dataset and its components.

The CDB community anticipates that additional standardization work will be required to prescribe content appropriate to targeted simulation applications, new use cases, and application in new domains. For example, in its current form, the CDB standard does not mandate synthetic environmental richness, quality and resolution.

=== OGC CDB 2.0

Beginning in late 2020, the OGC CDB SWG began discussion on what CDB version 2.0 might have as an architecture, what additional encodings and.or formats might be supported, and so forth. These discussion also included initial thoughts on a CDB 2.0 conceptual model. However, progress was slow - in part due to other OGC Member commitments and resource constraints.

NOTE: In the OGC, a major version number indicates that the new version is not backwards compatible with previous versions of the standard. The use of major revisions allows for a major evolution and enhancement to any OGC Standard.

A number of the major requirements for version 2.0 have been discussed for some time and have been captured in various OGC documents including formal Change Requests and OGC Interoperability Program Engineering Reports.

Some of the major enhancements that have been discussed and documented are:

.  Develop an approach (and model?) for using any attribution controlled vocabulary in a CDB data store.
.  Determine if the current tiling scheme is optimal or should be enhanced/replaced with a better tiling approach.
.  Describe explicitly how the CDB model may or may not align with the OGC DGGS standard;
.  Provide best practice details on how to use others OGC standards such as WMS and WFS as well as they new OGC APIs to access existing CDB data stores. This work may require Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions;
.  Extend the supported encodings and formats for a CDB structured data store to include the use of the CityGML, and InDoorGML standards as well as other broadly used community encoding standards, such as glTF and GeoTIFF. This work may require performing OGC Interoperability Experiments to better understand the implications of these decisions.
.  Further align CDB terminology to be fully consistent with OGC/ISO terminology.

Making these enhancements may allow the use and implementation of a CDB structured data store for application areas in addition to aviation simulators.

=== Attribution - An OGC Testbed 13 CDB Activity in 

The Testbed 13 http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-042.html[CDB Engineering Report] (ER) summarizes the CDB sub-thread activity. The CDB Testbed activity was divided into three main work packages:

- A feasibility study; 
- The implementation of data models and schemas mapping that are based on the feasibility study results; and 
- A set of OGC web services that implement the CDB in the form of WFS and WCS (Web Coverage Service) instances.

This Testbed 13 ER describes the approach taken and the results of the experimentation:

- The conceptual model of an OGC CDB 1.0 datastore as a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram to show different datasets (the 3D models, vector features and coverages);
- How to process and use a NAS-based Profile as a CDB feature/attribute data model or a GML-SF0 application schema;
- How to access, navigate, and visualize a CDB dataset using OGC web services (such as WFS and WCS).

The Testbed 13 CDB activity also resulted in a formal http://ogc.standardstracker.org/show_request.cgi?id=544[OGC Change Request Proposal] that was submitted for consideration in April 2018. The Change Request provides:

- Recommendations for replacing FACC feature code and indexing structure to be consistent with the application schemas (e.g. NAS data model) under discussion for the OGC CDB 2.0;
- Recommendations for supporting application schemas in CDB (level of complexity: Esri Geodatabase, GML-Simple Features Level 0 application schema) are being discussed for the OGC CDB 2.0;
- A method to expand the supported encodings and formats for an OGC CDB compliant datastore;
- Guidance on generating a coherent attribute schema for CDB 1.0 based on the "CDB_Attribute.xml" file.

The CDB-X Attribution experimentation builds on the Testbed 13 work.
